This is a program that asks for the beginning balance and the number of checks written. Then computes and displays youre balence after serveise fees. 
- Has logic and error handleing for miss imputs and incorrect negtive numbers.
- Is able to tell you if you are going to be overdrafted by service fees
- Uses 'for' and 'while' loops for prossing/converting numbers and is able to be used more then once if user inputs to do so.
